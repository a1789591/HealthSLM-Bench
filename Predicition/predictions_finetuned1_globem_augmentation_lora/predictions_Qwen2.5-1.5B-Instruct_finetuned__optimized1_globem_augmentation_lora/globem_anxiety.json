Additionally, the duration the user spent to fall asleep is significantly higher than usual (355 mins), suggesting an efficient sleep process. These factors contribute to a low anxiety score. ### Next Steps:\nGiven this prediction, there might not be a",

The predicted PHQ-4 anxiety score is 0. ### Prediction Explanation:\nThe model predicts a PHQ-4 anxiety score of 0 because the user's sleep efficiency (sleep efficiency) is very high at 97.3076923076923%, indicating minimal disruption during sleep. Additionally, the duration for falling asleep is extremely short at 0.0 mins, suggesting no significant difficulty in falling asleep. These factors contribute to an overall low anxiety level. ### Next Steps:\nGiven the low anxiety",

Please respond with a number. 0 means no anxiety, while 4 means extreme anxiety. To simplify, assume that the duration the user spent to fall asleep, duration the user stayed awake but still in bed, duration the user stayed in bed after waking up, duration the user took to fall back to sleep after not being in bed, Steps the",

The predicted PHQ-4 anxiety score is 0. Based on the sensor readings and user information, what is the corresponding anxiety level?\nA. Normal\nB. A little anxious, C. Somewhat anxious, D. Severely anxious To determine the PHQ-4 anxiety score, we need to consider both the physiological data (sleep efficiency) and the user's overall well-being.\n\nThe sleep efficiency shows that the user had an efficient sleep with minimal disruptions. This suggests good quality of sleep. However, the duration of wakefulness before falling",
