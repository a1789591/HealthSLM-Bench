Additionally, the duration the user spends awake before falling asleep is also low at 28% of the total duration, suggesting good sleep quality.

Additionally, the duration of wakefulness before falling asleep (duration the user stayed awake but still in bed) is also low at 42.8571428571429",

The predicted PHQ-4 depression score is 2.\nThe predicted PHQ-4 depression score is 2. Based on the provided sensor readings and user information, the predicted PHQ-4 depression score is 2. This indicates that the individual's current state of mental health does not meet the criteria for a higher level of depression as per the PHQ-4 scale. However, it's important to note that this prediction can vary depending on the specific context and the model used for prediction. For more accurate predictions, consider using models trained",
