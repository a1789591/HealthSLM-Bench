It's important to note that this prediction can vary depending on many factors including but not not limited to, how you perceive yourself at any given moment, what kind of day it is, how much sleep did you get, etc. If you find the stress score to low or high than please let",

The predicted stress level is 2. To arrive at this prediction, we considered the recent 14 days of the following features: [Steps], [Burned Calorories], [Resting Heart Rate], [SleepMinutes]. We also took into account the user's [Mood] score which was 4 out of 5.\nThe predicted stress level is 2. Based on the recent sensor readings and the user's mood score, the model predicts that the user is experiencing moderate stress. The detailed breakdown includes:\n\n",
