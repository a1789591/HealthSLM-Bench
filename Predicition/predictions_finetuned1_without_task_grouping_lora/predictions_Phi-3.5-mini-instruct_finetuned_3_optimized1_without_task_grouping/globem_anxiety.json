The recent 14-days sensor readings show: [Steps] is 10599.1428571429. [Sleep] efficiency, duration the user stayed in bed after waking up, duration the user spent to fall asleep, duration the user stayed awake but still in bed, duration the user spent to fall asleep are 91.7142857142857, 1.71428571428571, 448.357142857143, 40.4285714285714, 0.0 mins in average; What would be the PHQ-4 anxiety score? The predicted PHQ-4 anxiety score is 0.5. Here, the steps to explain the prediction:\n\n1. **Steps Data Analysis**: The first step is to analyze the steps data. The average steps per day is calculated by dividing the total steps by the number of days, which in this case is 14. The average steps per day is 10599.1428571429.\n\n2. **Sleep Efficiency Calculation**:",
        "true_result": "The predicted PHQ-4 anxiety score is 0."
