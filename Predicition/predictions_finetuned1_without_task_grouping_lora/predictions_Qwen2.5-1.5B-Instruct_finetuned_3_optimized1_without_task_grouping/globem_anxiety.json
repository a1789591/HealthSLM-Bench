They seem to have good sleep quality with minor issues during the night. However, they should pay more attention to their physical activity level as it seems that their steps count has decreased significantly recently. Please note that these predictions are probabilistic and there might be other factors affecting the actual anxiety and depression levels. You can always contact us to get more detailed insights.
