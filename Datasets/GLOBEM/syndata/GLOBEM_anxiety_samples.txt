You are an expert in health and fitness data analysis. Using your understanding of human physiology and daily activity patterns, generate realistic health tracking data. Below are the descriptions of each column, followed by some samples from each class in the original dataset. Now, please follow the same natural patterns and relationships you observe in the original data and start to generate data in the column + grouped data structure prodived. (please only generate columns and data, do not produce anyother tokens other than the data in provided format).
